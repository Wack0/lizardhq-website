<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Dell System Detect (DSD) is &quot;an application that runs on your Windows-based PC or tablet with your permission and interacts with the Dell Support website so that we can provide a better and more personalized support experience.&quot;</p>

<p>An issue in Dell System Detect, versions 6.12.0.1 and below, can be exploited to bypass UAC.</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

<p>Dell System Detect starts an HTTPd on localhost that listen on one of four ports: 8884, 8883, 8886 or 8885.</p>

<p>The APIs exposed by this HTTPd are protected by two methods:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Referer and origin header checks, referer or origin domain must be one of several Dell-owned domains.</p></li>
<li><p>Specific API methods can only be called with the correct signature, generated via an RSA-1024 key.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first method can easily be bypassed by code running on the system (or a man-in-the-middle for that matter).</p>

<p>The second can also be easily bypassed, as specific pages on Dell&#39;s site can be scraped to gain valid signatures for some interesting APIs.</p>

<p>The Dell System Detect executable has a valid code signature; and on startup, if not started with specific arguments it tries to elevate itself.</p>

<p>Assuming the user denies the elevation. the <code>checkadminrights</code> API also tries to elevate. The API supposedly returns false if DSD is not elevated, but in practise, it returned true all the time.</p>

<p>This bug can be worked around by using the time that the request took to execute. With experimentation, it seems that if the API request had taken over 200ms, then a UAC request dialog had been spawned.</p>

<p>After the user has confirmed elevation, a wait must occur for DSD to restart its HTTPd. It seems a delay of 200ms every loop is adequate for this.</p>

<p>When DSD has been elevated, a second API, <code>installmanual</code>, can be used to run any file. The <code>\\</code> character is filtered out, but the <code>/</code> character can be used as a replacement.</p>

<p>A PoC is available as <code>dellsystempwned.d</code> in <a href="http://rol.im/oemdrop/">this trio of OEM exploit PoCs.</a></p>

<h1>Affected Versions</h1>

<p>6.12.0.1 and below.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>

<p>Not even uninstallation of Dell System Detect will prevent exploitation of these issues; it runs from <code>%APPDATA%</code> so malware could easily drop it on your system to exploit this issue.</p>

<p>The checkadminrights method is hardcoded to execute <code>DellSystemDetect.exe</code> so, uninstallation of Dell System Detect and blacklisting of <code>DellSystemDetect.exe</code> from being executed will prevent exploitation of these issues.</p>

<p>The researchers cannot sanction any mitigations except to perform these actions.</p>
